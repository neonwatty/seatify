## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: Problem Hook
| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 0:00 – 0:03 (3 seconds) |
| **Visual** | App canvas showing 8+ tables with visible red conflict badges/warning indicators. Slightly chaotic feel — guests unassigned or poorly placed. |
| **Text Overlay** | "Seating charts shouldn't be this hard." |
| **Action** | Static shot or slow zoom out to show scale of the problem |
| **Music** | Starts with slight tension or anticipation |

**Recording notes:** Before recording, manually create some conflicts by placing guests who should be separated at the same table. The red indicators create visual "chaos."

---

### Scene 2: Product Introduction
| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 0:03 – 0:08 (5 seconds) |
| **Visual** | Clean canvas view. Cursor drags a guest card from sidebar onto a table — satisfying snap animation as guest lands in seat. |
| **Text Overlay** | "Meet Seatify" (show for 1-2 seconds, then fade) |
| **Action** | One smooth drag-and-drop motion |
| **Music** | Transitions to lighter, optimistic tone |

**Recording notes:** Use a guest with a clear, readable name. Drag slowly and deliberately so viewers can follow the motion.

---

### Scene 3: The Complexity Setup
| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 0:08 – 0:13 (5 seconds) |
| **Visual** | Quick sequence: (1) Zoom out to show full canvas with many tables, (2) Guest sidebar scrolls to show 50+ names, (3) Flash to relationship matrix showing partner connections and "avoid" markers |
| **Text Overlay** | "Couples. Conflicts. Constraints." |
| **Action** | 2-3 quick cuts or smooth transitions |
| **Music** | Building anticipation |

**Recording notes:** This is fast-paced. Record each element separately and edit together. The relationship matrix shot should clearly show at least one "Partner" (green) and one "Avoid" (red) connection.

---

### Scene 4: The Optimizer (HERO MOMENT)
| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 0:13 – 0:21 (8 seconds) |
| **Visual** | Full optimizer sequence |
| **Text Overlay** | "One click. Perfect seating." |
| **Music** | Peaks here — this is the climax |

**Detailed breakdown:**

| Timestamp | Action | Duration |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 0:13-0:14 | Cursor moves to and clicks "Optimize Seating" button | 1s |
| 0:14-0:17 | Guests visually shuffle/animate across tables (the magic moment) | 3s |
| 0:17-0:19 | Score appears: "Optimization Score: 94%" with category breakdown | 2s |
| 0:19-0:21 | Quick highlight: couple seated together, "avoid" pair now separated | 2s |

**Recording notes:** This is your money shot. Make sure the optimization produces visible, dramatic changes. If the shuffle animation is subtle, you may need to do a before/after cut to emphasize the difference.

---

### Scene 5: Mobile Flexibility
| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 0:21 – 0:25 (4 seconds) |
| **Visual** | Phone screen showing the same seating chart. Finger gestures: pinch to zoom, pan across tables, tap a table to see guest list. |
| **Text Overlay** | "Plan anywhere." |
| **Action** | 2-3 natural touch gestures |
| **Music** | Maintains energy |

**Recording notes:** Use screen recording on the phone or film the physical device. Keep gestures smooth and natural. Show the same event/data as desktop for continuity.

---

### Scene 6: Call to Action
| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 0:25 – 0:30 (5 seconds) |
| **Visual** | Quick flash of PDF export preview (1s), then transition to clean CTA screen |
| **Text Overlays** | Animate in sequence: |
| | 1. "100% Free" |
| | 2. "No Signup Required" |
| | 3. "Your Data Stays Private" |
| | **Final:** "Start planning at **seatify.app**" |
| **Music** | Resolves, ends cleanly |

**Recording notes:** The trust badges should feel confident, not defensive. Quick animations (fade or slide in) keep energy up. End on a clear, readable URL.

## Typography Recommendations

- **Font:** Clean sans-serif (SF Pro, Inter, or similar)
- **Size:** Large enough to read on mobile (test at 480px width)
- **Color:** White text with subtle drop shadow or dark semi-transparent background for readability
- **Animation:** Simple fades or slides — nothing flashy that distracts from the product

---

## Music Guidance

**Mood:** Upbeat, modern, optimistic — think "productivity app launch"
**Tempo:** Medium-fast (100-120 BPM)
**Avoid:** Lyrics, heavy bass, anything that overshadows the visuals

**Where to find:**
- Epidemic Sound (subscription)
- Artlist (subscription)
- YouTube Audio Library (free)
- Screen Studio built-in library

## Editing Notes

1. **Pacing:** Keep it snappy. If a scene feels slow, trim it.
2. **Transitions:** Simple cuts or quick fades. No fancy wipes.
3. **Cursor:** Make sure cursor is visible and movements are deliberate, not jerky.
4. **Export:** 1080p minimum, 4K if possible. MP4 format.
5. **Aspect ratios to consider:**
   - 16:9 (standard, YouTube, landing page)
   - 9:16 (Instagram/TikTok Stories — crop carefully)
   - 1:1 (Instagram feed, LinkedIn)
